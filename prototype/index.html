                        The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the United States. 
                        It is characterized by student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support social, 
                        academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by the 
                        UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are <strong>intramural sports and fitness programs</strong>, 
                        <strong>diversity programs</strong>, <strong>leadership development</strong>, <strong>peer tutoring
                        </strong>, <strong>student government association</strong>, <strong>student support programs</strong> 
                        including groups for <em>non-traditional and first-generation students</em>, a <strong>student-run newspaper
                        </strong>, and <strong>fraternity and sorority life</strong>. The proximity of the UA Little Rock 
                        campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to take advantage of a wide array of <strong>recreational, 
                        entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities</strong> that are not 
                        available anywhere else in Arkansas.[20]

                        UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from traditional 
                        resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments. The university has <strong>four residence halls</strong> 
                        on the eastern side of the campus and the <strong>University Village Apartment Complex</strong> on the 
                        southern side of campus. <strong>Six learning communities</strong> focusing on criminal justice, arts and 
                        culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, nursing careers, and STEM are available to students.

                        UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating 
                        in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football 
                        (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in <strong>1955</strong> when it 
                        was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens 
                        Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:

                        Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team 
                        (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. 
                        Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in <strong>2019</strong>, and is the first Division I 
                        program in Arkansas.
