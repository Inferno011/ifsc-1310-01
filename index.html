                <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
                <p> 
                    The first thing I think about when I hear the words <q>Web Accessibility</q> is making the web accessible to disabled people. This is typically done through using proper semantics
                    along with adding attributes that describe unreadable content to tags and elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But web accessibility does not just mean <q> accessible to disabled people</q> it also encompasses other things like people with limited internet bandwidth.
                    While internet access around the world has significantly improved, In many rural areas around the world internet access is incredibly slow and limited. So 
                    making websites that can load quickly and not require much bandwidth can help in these cases.
