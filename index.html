                <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
                <p> 
                    The first thing I think about when I hear the words <q>Web Accessibility</q> is making the web accesible to disabled people. This is typicaly done through using propper sematics
                    along with adding atrributes that describe unreadable content to tags and elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But web accesibility does not just mean <q>accesible to disabled people</q> it also encompeses others things like people with limited internet bandwidth.
                    While internet access around the world has significantly improved, In many rural areas around the world internet access is incredibly slow and limited. So 
                    making websiteds that can load quickly and not require much badwidth can help help in  these cases.
